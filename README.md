# HeritageMap
# Welcome to my Shiny App that displays UNESCO sites in a personalized way! 
# Features: It depicts all unesco sites in a map with interactive filtering.
#           Additionally, you can add visiting dates of yourself and friends and visualize these, too

# README
# The whole code consists of three R files: server.R, ui.R and sites.R

# The app itself is run via the files server.R and ui.R 
# For some background go to: https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/

# sites.R is used to create the underlying csv file, used by the app as a database of sorts.
# It is only used for initial setup and when the official list has been amended. This takes place usually every year/
# every other year.
